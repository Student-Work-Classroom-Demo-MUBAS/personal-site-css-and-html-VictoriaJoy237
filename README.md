# Victoria M'bwana's Portifolio

## Design Choice
1. The theme for this website is blue and most of the colors are done with the help of color hunt. 
2. The goal is to keep the layout simple allowing the functionality to show.


## What I found most Difficult

1. Implementing consistent bhaviour among different pages is a bit difficult. It needs one to stay focused and remember where they are coming form everytep of the way.


## What I am most proud of
1. I am happy that I'm able to link sections,pages, images etc withouth much difficulty
2. Another thing I'm proud of is that my website design is improving as I go, the sketched plan is getting better.
