# Victoria M'bwana's Portifolio

## Design Choice
1. The theme for this website is blue and most of the colors are done with the help of color hunt. 
2. The goal is to keep the layout simple allowing the functionality to show.
3. It fist started out as a very plain and straight website, but I got more inspiration on the way as i discovered i can do more with css styling. 
4. My design perspective also changed after acertain tutorial which highlited that personal portifolios are not about the owner, the tutorial explain that it is all about the person reading. It advised to not focus more about hsowcasing yourself but letting the reader know what you do. 


## What I found most Difficult

1. Implementing consistent bhaviour among different pages is a bit difficult. It needs one to stay focused and remember where they are coming form everytep of the way.
2. Learning new concepts along the way and applying them to my design is also astruggle. I would find myself a little lost and unable to apply the new things that i've learnt.I even gave up on somthings cuse they were a bit hard to implement,but Im hoping to learn and get better with time.


## What I am most proud of
1. I am happy that I'm able to link sections,pages, images etc withouth much difficulty
2. Another thing I'm proud of is that my website design is improving as I go, the sketched plan is getting better.
