# Victoria M'bwana's Portifolio

## Design Choice

1. The theme for this website is blue and most of the colors are done with the help of color hunt. 
2. The goal is to keep the layout simple allowing the functionality to show.
3. It fist started out as a very plain and straight website, but I got more inspiration on the way as i discovered i can do more with css styling. 
4. My design perspective also changed after acertain tutorial which highlited that personal portifolios are not about the owner, the tutorial explain that it is all about the person reading. It advised to not focus more about hsowcasing yourself but letting the reader know what you do. 
5. The design was done section but section for easy follow up.
6. Ive added a sticky navigation bar and hovering effects to enhance the design.


## What I found most Difficult

1. Implementing consistent behaviour among different pages is a bit difficult. It needs one to stay focused and remember where they are coming form everytep of the way.
2. Learning new concepts along the way and applying them to my design is also astruggle. I would find myself a little lost and unable to apply the new things that i've learnt.I even gave up on somthings cuse they were a bit hard to implement,but Im hoping to learn and get better with time.
3. My class names were scattered and a litttle hard to follow through but i was ableto fixthe issue.
4. i dicthed some featured half way casue i could not undestand there flow: but will try to review them and get there operation.
5. Some fonts looked messy on the web page; had to research what most websites do.
6. Reusable components sounded smart; but implementing them was not so easy.

## What I am most proud of

1. I am happy that I'm able to link sections,pages, images etc withouth much difficulty
2. Another thing I'm proud of is that my website design is improving as I go, the sketched plan is getting better.
3. A fixed nav bar felt good to achieve.
4. The proces itdel has helped me learn alot of styling techniques.
